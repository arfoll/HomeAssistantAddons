5. Set the config options.

![Install add-on](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/ScreenShot6.png)

The following options are mandatory:
- sungrow_user
- sungrow_password - Make sure you have created your account at https://isolarcloud.com/

- sungrow_mqtt_user
- sungrow_mqtt_password - Enter in your login details for HA.

You may have to set the following options. As of v3.0.0 if you leave the blank, it'll autoconfigure:
- sungrow_mqtt_host
- sungrow_mqtt_port

The rare occasion:
- sungrow_host - May need to be changed depending on which global server you connect to.
- sungrow_appkey - Just don't. Really don't, but if you want to hack. Then do!
- sungrow_timeout - Useful if your iSolarCloud global gateway is slow/unreachable.
- sungrow_debug - If you REALLY want to see some noise. Just leave it unset.

5. Start it up!

## Lovelace examples

These are the Lovelace YAML files I use for my HA instance:

[LoveLace-Basic.yaml](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/LoveLace-Basic.yaml)
[LoveLace-Stats.yaml](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/LoveLace-Stats.yaml)
[LoveLace-Graphs.yaml](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/LoveLace-Graphs.yaml)

You'll need to modify the ps_id and ps_keys within these files to display the correct info. Any text editor can do a global search and replace.

You can use the GoSungrow tool to get this info:
  GoSungrow show ps tree
  
You'll also need to grab some common 3rd party lovelace frontends:

[Canvas Gauge Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/canvas-gauge-card)
[mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)

All available easily in HACS.
